This is the front-end (no AI functionality) for GDSC's 2-semester-long community tech project. This interface will allow users to create their own artificial intelligence created music. Users can either upload their own sample to base the song on, or they can select from the provided options.

The intention of the project was to play music a music model from Google's Magenta project. We ran out of time to complete the planned project after the course of the year after some difficulty getting the model to run.
